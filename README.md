# Chapter 13 Analysis

Exploring Chapter 13 bankruptcy outcomes using my anonymized case and public data. 
This repo will hold CSVs and notebooks as I learn data analytics.

## About this project

I filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and I want to understand why completion rates are low. 
This repository will hold my anonymized case plus public data so I can practice SQL, Python, and data visualization. 
Planned analyses: completion rates over time, by state, by income level.
